#Regular Updates about me

It's been quiet a time since the last post.
Things have changed quiet a lot as well.

First, I quitted my job from 3billion. The reason is, simply put, I wanted to move faster. Spend more time on topics that I wanted to focus on. Achieve the goal that I am in pursuit within 5 years time frame.

On my point of view, there are many companies insisting that they are doing state-of-the-art technology in so-called 'healthcare' sectors, but can't really view it as the technological edge. Information technology has not been rooted strongly in the sector, but things are changing. Things will be very different from now on.
The world is at its phase where it's components are recognizing the power of the technology that have been the most powerful recently. AI.

This is where things will be all different in a next decade. 'Artificial intelligence is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.' (link to the wikipedia page:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) AI is a knowledge machine. The best thing it does is bringing in all the knowledge that it was trained.
