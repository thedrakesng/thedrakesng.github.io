This post is 266 days behind the actual project.

As a product owner and project manager for the genomic analysis and interpretation tool GEBRA, one of the first crucial steps I took was to clarify the project's goals. Setting clear goals is essential for the success of any project. In this post, I want to highlight why goals matter and how they influence project outcomes.

## Why Goals Matter 

Having a clear goal increases the chances of success:

$$ \text{Probability of success with goals} \geq \text{Probability of success without goals} $$

To understand the factors affecting the probability of success, let's consider an equation based on the "fast failure" method. Assume that each project attempt has the same probability of success (\( p \)) and that success is so definitive that you don't need a second one. The number of projects attempted is \( n \).

The probability of achieving success increases with each project attempt:

$$ \text{Total Success} = \text{Probability of Single Success} + \text{Probability of Success After Failure} $$

Mathematically, it can be expressed as a sum of probabilities that reduces to:

$$ \text{Total Success} = \frac{p(1 - (1-p)^n)}{1 - (1-p)} $$

Here, \( p \) is the probability of success for a single project, and \( n \) is the number of project attempts. Simply put, the more attempts you have, the more likely you are to achieve success.

The number of attempts $\text{n}$ is influenced by:

$$ n = \frac{\text{Total Budget}}{\text{Cost Per Project}} $$

Where:

- $$ \text{Cost Per Project} = \text{Project Time} \times \text{Daily Expenditure} $$
- $\text{Project Time}$ is determined by the amount of work needed to achieve the project's goals.

Assuming each project requires a certain $\text{Total Achievement}$, we have:

$$ \text{Total Achievement} = \text{Project Time} \times \text{Daily Achievement} + \text{Previous Achievement} $$

Where:

$$ \text{Daily Achievement} = \text{Cohesion} \times \text{Individual Ability} - \text{Unnecessary Work} $$

Substituting back, the **Cost Per Project** becomes:

$$ \text{Cost Per Project} = \frac{\text{Total Achievement} - \text{Previous Achievement}}{\text{Cohesion} \times \text{Individual Ability} - \text{Unnecessary Work}} \times \text{Daily Expenditure} $$

Therefore, $\text{n}$ increases with:

1. Greater Budget.
2. Projects requiring fewer achievements to complete but maintaining the same probability of success.
3. Accumulated previous achievements (e.g., references, API resources, prior work, and etc).
4. Strong team cohesion.
5. High individual abilities of team members.
6. Minimization of unnecessary work.
7. Lower daily expenditure.

**Setting clear goals directly impacts factors 4 and 6.**

## How Clear Goals Enhance Success

### 1. Strengthening Team Cohesion

Clear goals enable the team to understand what needs to be achieved, promoting better communication and increasing cohesion. Communication is essential, especially in a multidisciplinary team like GEBRA, which includes medical genetics experts, web developers, BI engineers, and AI engineers. Each team has different domain knowledge and perspectives, making it challenging to align on vague objectives. Defining specific goalsâ€”such as creating a product that provides:

1. Precise and reliable outcomes
2. Fast analysis
3. High usability

helped unifying the team's efforts.

### 2. Reducing Unnecessary Work

Clear goals guide the project direction, preventing team members from pursuing well-intentioned but potentially unnecessary features. While adding new features might improve the product, it could also divert resources from essential tasks. Clear goals help in making informed decisions about what to include, ensuring that efforts contribute directly to the project's success without compromising team cohesion.

Goals serve as a North Star, guiding the project journey.

## Additional Benefits of Clear Goals

Goals act as benchmarks to measure project success. By defining clear objectives, you enable "validated learning," a concept from the famous book *Lean Startup*. Without goals, you can neither fail nor succeed meaningfully. Clear goals help you identify successes and failures, allowing you to increase the probability of success ($\text{p}$) with each new project.

In short, with clear goals:

${P_{n-1}} < {P_{n}$


## How We Set Clear Goals

Our method involved establishing a persona for the product. The GEBRA team identified the following target user through experience and feasibility tests:

1. An expert in rare diseases,
2. Performs genomic tests regularly,
3. Needs to increase productivity.

From this persona, we set goals from business, genetic/medical, and technological perspectives. I hope to share the details of these goals in the near future.
