{% assign past_date = '2024-01-12' | date: '%s' %}
{% assign current_date = site.time | date: '%s' %}
{% assign difference_in_seconds = current_date | minus: past_date %}
{% assign days_difference = difference_in_seconds | divided_by: 86400 | floor %}

This post is {{ days_difference }} days behind the actual project.

In the last post, I wrote about the benefit of setting clear goals in project management.

This post is about how we, GEBRA team, set goals for the project.

From the beginning, this project had its own distinct characteristics.

1. The product already existed
2. 

This time I want to share my experience through the concept of product market fit.

## Product Market Fit

Product Market Fit (PMF) is defined as the point when or the degree to which a product satisfies a market demand. Even though it is vaguely defined, product market fit is a strong concept and a tool to deliver steps we need to take to build a successful business. Finding a product market fit is to make a product that solves problems and deliver it to the people who need it. It is a goal of every service providers.

The pyramid illustrates components of PMF. These components correspond to the steps one needs to take to find product market fit.

1. Define the market
2. Understand market's pain point
3. Align value proposition
4. Develop your product accordingly
5. and continue



In this perspective, GEBRA project has already went through some .

## Redefining the market

We couldn't aim for the same client with WES and WGS that the company has provided for years as GEBRA, by its nature, is different from the genomic tests.
