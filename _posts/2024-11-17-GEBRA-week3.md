# Let’s Talk About Product-Market Fit

## What Is Product-Market Fit?

**Product-Market Fit (PMF)** is the point at which a product effectively satisfies a significant market demand. While PMF can be defined in various ways, it represents a crucial concept and framework for building a successful business. Achieving PMF means creating a product that solves real problems and delivering it to the people who need it. It’s a key milestone for all service providers.

The pyramid above illustrates the key components of PMF. Each component corresponds to a step on the journey toward finding the right fit:

**Steps to Find PMF:**
1. Define your market
2. Understand the market’s pain points
3. Align your value proposition
4. Develop your product (features & user experience)
5. Iterate based on feedback

## Market for Variant Interpretation Software

In the case of variant interpretation software, we cannot simply target the same clients who purchase WES (Whole Exome Sequencing) and WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing) services. GEBRA, by nature, differs from these genomic tests, necessitating a unique market approach.

**Potential Market:**  
If we define GEBRA as an interpretation software that provides accurate genomic test interpretations and boosts productivity, then its potential market size corresponds to the entire genomic testing market.

**Available Market:**  
The available market would be those who conduct genomic testing in-house, such as institutions, core labs, hospitals, and service providers (including 3billion itself).

**Penetrated Market:**  
Once organizations adopt the software, they form the penetrated market. Today, multiple hospitals, diagnostic labs, and related entities have integrated interpretation software solutions.

## Identifying the Market’s Pain Points

After defining the market, the next step is to pinpoint its pain points. Understanding these challenges guides you in offering a solution that genuinely improves workflows and outcomes.

Consider this simple value equation:

$\text{Value} = \text{Benefits} - \text{Cost}$

To increase product value, we either increase benefits or reduce costs for the customer. Identifying pain points helps guide both of these improvements.

**How Did We Discover the Pain Points at 3billion?**  
1. Conducting user interviews
2. Leveraging our in-house genetics experts

Through these efforts, we identified pain points that aligned well with GEBRA’s strengths.

## Aligning the Value Proposition

Once you understand the pain points, the product must align with the value proposition. This requires continuous communication, clear principles, and a strong vision.

When alignment is successful, these outcomes occur:

1. **Customer Relevance:**  
   The product addresses a genuine need.  
   *Measured by:* Interviews, Surveys, Market Segmentation, User Testing

2. **Clear Differentiation:**  
   Customers understand why your product is superior to competitors.  
   *Measured by:* Competitive Benchmarking, Brand Perception Studies

3. **Consistent Messaging:**  
   Marketing, sales, and support all convey a coherent value promise.  
   *Measured by:* Brand Audits, Stakeholder Interviews, Content Analysis

4. **Higher Customer Satisfaction:**  
   When customers receive the promised value, satisfaction and loyalty increase.  
   *Measured by:* CSAT, NPS, Retention/Churn Analysis, Support Ticket Reviews

## Developing the Product

Next, you must develop the product. While specific development details vary, consider two overarching dynamics:

1. **Tech Push:**  
   Products driven by technological innovation and scientific breakthroughs. The focus is on advancing what’s possible.

2. **Market Pull:**  
   Products shaped by identified customer needs and market demands. The focus is on delivering solutions to actual problems.

While technological advancement is critical, I believe the essence of any product lies in addressing the customer’s real-world challenges—something often overlooked in certain fields.

## Conclusion

Product development is a continuous effort to achieve Product-Market Fit. PMF is built upon four major pillars:

- Defining the market  
- Identifying pain points  
- Aligning the value proposition  
- Developing the product accordingly

By constantly iterating through these steps, you move closer to achieving PMF. GEBRA is on its journey, and we look forward to fruitful outcomes.
