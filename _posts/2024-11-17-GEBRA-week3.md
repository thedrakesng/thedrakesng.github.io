Let's talk about Product Market Fit  today.

## Product Market Fit

Product-Market Fit (PMF) is the point at which a product effectively satisfies a strong market demand. Although it can be defined in various ways, PMF represents a crucial concept and framework for building a successful business. Achieving PMF means creating a product that solves genuine problems and delivering it to the people who need it. It’s a key milestone for all service providers.

The pyramid above illustrates the components of PMF, each corresponding to a step in the journey toward finding the right fit:

**Steps to Find PMF:**

1. Define your market
2. Understand the market's pain points
3. Align your value proposition
4. Develop your product (Features & UX)
5. Iterate based on feedback


## Market of variant interpretation software

WWhen it comes to variant interpretation software, we cannot simply target the same customers who purchase WES (Whole Exome Sequencing) and WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing) services. This is because GEBRA, by its very nature, differs from those genomic tests.

To understand this market, consider the following diagram:

![Market definition from NetMBA.com](assets/image/marketdefinition_NetMBA.com.gif)

Potential Market:

We define GEBRA as an interpretation software that provides accurate genomic test interpretation and boosts productivity for professionals in the field, then the potential market size corresponds to the entire market for genomic tests.

Available Market:

The available market would be those who conduct genomic testing themselves—this includes institutions, core labs, hospitals, and service providers (such as 3billion itself).

Penetrated Market:

Once users adopt the software, they form the penetrated market. Today, multiple hospitals, diagnostic labs, and other organizations have integrated interpretation software into their workflows.

## Identifying the Market’s Pain Points

After defining the market, the next step is to pinpoint its pain points. The core idea is to understand what challenges or inefficiencies exist, so we can address them directly.

A simple value equation is helpful here:

$\text{Value} = \text{Benefits} - \text{Cost}$

To increase product value, we can either increase the benefits or reduce the costs for the customer. Discovering the market’s pain points helps guide us in achieving both goals.

How did we discover the pain points at 3billion?

1. Expanding the benefit of the market
2. Reducing the cost of the market

Through multiple iterations of user interviews and insights from our internal team, we identified pain points that aligned neatly with GEBRA’s advantages.

Discovery of the pain point can be done by numerous methods, but 3billion took simple approaches by:

1. Interviewing users
2. Having an internal expert

Through multiple iterations of user interview, and thanks to our in-house genetics team. We were able to discover the pain point, and lucky for us it aligned to advantages of GEBRA. 


## Aligning the Value Proposition

Once the pain points are clear, the product must be aligned with the value proposition—this requires constant communication, well-defined principles, and a clear vision.

When value proposition alignment is successful, the following outcomes occur:

1. Customer Relevance:
Customers feel the product addresses a genuine need.

*Measured by*: Interviews, Surveys, Market Segmentation, User Testing

2. Clear Differentiation:
Customers understand why your product is superior to competitors.

*Measured by*: Competitive Benchmarking, Brand Perception Studies

3. Consistent Messaging:
Marketing, sales, and support channels communicate a cohesive message that reinforces the value proposition.

*Measured by*: Brand Audits, Stakeholder Interviews, Content Analysis

4. Higher Customer Satisfaction:
When customers receive the value they expect, satisfaction, loyalty, and referrals increase.

*Measured by*: CSAT Surveys, NPS, Customer Retention/Churn Analysis

## Developing the Product

With a value proposition in place, the next step is product development. While the details of development aren’t the focus here, it’s important to consider two overarching dynamics:

1. Tech push

"Tech push" refers to a strategy or situation where new technologies or products are developed primarily due to technological advancements or scientific breakthroughs within a company or research institution. In this scenario, the driving force behind introducing a product to the market is the technology itself.

*Focus*: Advancing what is possible with new tech.

2. Market pull

"Market pull" is the opposite scenario, where the motivation to develop or refine a product originates from identified customer needs, market demands, or emerging trends. Here, the market signals what kind of product or improvements it wants, and companies respond by creating solutions that address these explicit needs. 

*Focus*: Delivering solutions to existing problems.

Personally I believe "Market pull" are often neglected in some field. There is not doubt that the technological advance must be considered and the company shall not fall behind in such trend, but I believe that the essence of the product lies in solving a problem of the customers.

## Conclusion

Product development is a continuous effort to achieve Product-Market Fit. PMF is built upon four major pillars:

- Defining the market
- Identifying pain points
- Aligning the value proposition
- Developing the product accordingly

These steps should be repeated in a cycle of constant iteration. GEBRA is on its way to finding its PMF, and we hope the results are fruitful.
