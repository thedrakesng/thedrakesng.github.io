{% assign past_date = '2024-01-12' | date: '%s' %}
{% assign current_date = site.time | date: '%s' %}
{% assign difference_in_seconds = current_date | minus: past_date %}
{% assign days_difference = difference_in_seconds | divided_by: 86400 | floor %}

Product Market Fit (PMF) is defined as the point when or the degree to which a product satisfies a market demand. Finding a product market fit is considered to be a goal for every company.
